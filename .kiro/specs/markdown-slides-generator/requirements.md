# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a system that converts markdown lecture files into two distinct outputs: beautiful, minimalist slides for presentations and academic-style book-like lecture notes. The system should be simple to use, technology-agnostic (supporting web, PowerPoint, or LaTeX outputs), and should work with special markdown syntax to denote slide boundaries and content organization. The primary goal is to maintain a single source of truth in markdown while generating both presentation slides and comprehensive lecture notes from the same content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a course instructor, I want to write lecture content once in markdown and generate both slides and lecture notes, so that I can maintain consistency while having appropriate formats for different use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide a markdown file with lecture content THEN the system SHALL generate both slide presentation and book-like lecture notes from the same source
2. WHEN I use special markdown syntax to denote slide boundaries THEN the system SHALL respect these boundaries when creating slides
3. WHEN content is marked for slides-only or notes-only THEN the system SHALL include that content only in the appropriate output format
4. IF no special syntax is provided THEN the system SHALL intelligently split content into slides based on headers and content structure

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a course instructor, I want the generated slides to be beautiful and minimalist, so that students can focus on the content without distractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN slides are generated THEN they SHALL have a clean, minimalist design with appropriate typography
2. WHEN slides contain code blocks THEN they SHALL be syntax-highlighted and properly formatted
3. WHEN slides contain mathematical formulas THEN they SHALL be rendered correctly using LaTeX math notation
4. WHEN slides contain images or diagrams THEN they SHALL be properly sized and positioned
5. IF slides become too content-heavy THEN the system SHALL automatically split them or warn the user

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a course instructor, I want the generated lecture notes to be in academic book format, so that students have comprehensive reference material for studying.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN lecture notes are generated THEN they SHALL include all content from the markdown file in a book-like academic format
2. WHEN lecture notes are generated THEN they SHALL include proper table of contents, page numbers, and academic formatting
3. WHEN lecture notes contain references THEN they SHALL be properly formatted with bibliography
4. WHEN lecture notes contain code examples THEN they SHALL be formatted with syntax highlighting and proper indentation
5. WHEN lecture notes contain mathematical content THEN they SHALL be rendered with proper LaTeX mathematical typography

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a course instructor, I want a simple program (Python or Node.js) that processes my markdown files, so that I can easily integrate this into my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the program THEN it SHALL accept a markdown file as input parameter
2. WHEN the program runs THEN it SHALL generate both slides and lecture notes as output files
3. WHEN I install the program THEN it SHALL have a simple requirements.txt (Python) or package.json (Node.js) for dependencies
4. WHEN the program encounters errors THEN it SHALL provide clear error messages and suggestions
5. IF the input markdown file doesn't exist THEN the program SHALL display a helpful error message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a course instructor, I want to use special markdown syntax to control slide generation, so that I have fine-grained control over what appears in slides versus notes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use slide boundary markers (e.g., `<!-- SLIDE -->`) THEN the system SHALL create new slides at those points
2. WHEN I use slide-only content markers (e.g., `<!-- SLIDE-ONLY -->`) THEN that content SHALL appear only in slides
3. WHEN I use notes-only content markers (e.g., `<!-- NOTES-ONLY -->`) THEN that content SHALL appear only in lecture notes
4. WHEN I use slide replacement markers THEN the system SHALL use alternative content for slides while keeping original in notes
5. WHEN I use return-to-normal markers (e.g., `<!-- ALL -->`) THEN the system SHALL resume including content in both slides and notes
6. IF no special markers are used THEN the system SHALL use intelligent defaults based on content structure

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a course instructor, I want to choose between different output formats (web, PowerPoint, LaTeX), so that I can use the format that best fits my presentation environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I specify web output THEN the system SHALL generate HTML slides (e.g., reveal.js format)
2. WHEN I specify PowerPoint output THEN the system SHALL generate .pptx files
3. WHEN I specify LaTeX output THEN the system SHALL generate .tex files for slides and notes
4. WHEN I don't specify an output format THEN the system SHALL default to web-based slides
5. IF an unsupported output format is requested THEN the system SHALL display available options

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a course instructor, I want the system to work with the existing lecture directory structure, so that I can process multiple lectures efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I point the system to a lecture directory THEN it SHALL process all markdown files in that directory
2. WHEN processing multiple files THEN the system SHALL maintain the same naming convention for outputs
3. WHEN processing a lecture directory THEN the system SHALL preserve the directory structure in outputs
4. IF a lecture directory contains non-markdown files THEN the system SHALL ignore them gracefully
5. WHEN batch processing THEN the system SHALL provide progress feedback and error reporting per file

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a course instructor, I want the generated content to preserve all formatting from the original markdown, so that complex academic content is accurately represented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN markdown contains tables THEN they SHALL be properly formatted in both slides and notes
2. WHEN markdown contains nested lists THEN the hierarchy SHALL be preserved in outputs
3. WHEN markdown contains inline code THEN it SHALL be properly highlighted and formatted
4. WHEN markdown contains block quotes THEN they SHALL be visually distinct in outputs
5. WHEN markdown contains links THEN they SHALL be functional in the appropriate output format
6. WHEN markdown contains LaTeX math expressions (inline `$...$` or block `$$...$$`) THEN they SHALL be properly rendered in both slides and notes

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a course instructor, I want full LaTeX support for mathematical and academic content, so that I can include complex formulas, equations, and academic notation in my lectures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I include inline LaTeX math (`$formula$`) THEN it SHALL be rendered inline in both slides and notes
2. WHEN I include block LaTeX math (`$$formula$$`) THEN it SHALL be rendered as a centered block in both slides and notes
3. WHEN I include LaTeX commands for symbols and notation THEN they SHALL be properly rendered
4. WHEN I choose LaTeX as output format THEN the system SHALL generate native LaTeX files that compile correctly
5. IF LaTeX rendering fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the problematic LaTeX code
