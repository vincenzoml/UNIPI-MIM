We develop open tools, reproducible experiments, and teaching materials that make formal verification methods accessible to imaging practitioners and students.

## The course

*This course stems from the need to bridge a specific gap between recent research, and university-level education, driven by major improvements in Artificial Intelligence, particularly deep learning. We aim to introduce logical and hybrid methods to students of the Informatics for Digital Health program, aligning with broader efforts toward trustworthy, explainable, accountable, and auditable AI in sensitive domains. In the field of Medical Image Analysis, model checking has shown promising results in applying logical methods to Computer Vision, and this will be a central theme of the course, while departing from the symbolic/deductive AI tradition.*

*While the methods presented here represent only a small part of the current research frontier, there is not yet a well-established methodology in this area. Thus, it is essential to foster the development and dissemination of these approaches among new generations which will be the ones shaping the actual implementation plan for digital health in age of Artificial Intelligence, and must possess all the needed instruments to critically evaluate and apply these methodologies.*

## The course notes

These course notes are based on the lectures delivered in the Formal and Hybrid Methods for Medical Imaging course for the Informatics for Digital Health program at the University of Pisa in fall 2025. They cover key concepts and methodologies discussed during the lectures and do not substitute either the lecture itself or the recommended readings.

The production of the course material **has been aided by AI agents**, but all inputs and outputs have been supervised, curated, and manually edited by the author—reflecting a human‑in‑the‑loop approach appropriate for safety‑critical contexts, which, recursively, is the major theme of the course. 

## Formal methods for Medical Imaging

This course focuses on a selection of topics positioned between classical programming and AI. For the symbolic part, we study *model checking*. This approach departs from the traditional deductive view of symbolic AI (theorem proving, logic programming) and instead emphasizes the pragmatic use of executable domain knowledge. Properties of a system (or, here, medical images and their derived feature structures) are specified formally and then automatically verified against concrete models using efficient algorithms. This paradigm, stemming from the tradition of Formal Methods in Computer Science, -- usually applied to the verification of systems of high complexity, such as  parallel programs, hardware devices, or secure communication protocols --  has proven effective in computer vision applications only relatively recently.


**Deductive tradition in symbolic AI:**  
The deductive tradition in symbolic AI dates back to the earliest logic‑inspired systems. Early programs such as the Logic Theorist and later the emergence of logic programming focused on deriving conclusions from axioms using inference rules, automated reasoning, and theorem proving. These approaches are powerful for expressing general knowledge and proving properties rigorously, but they struggle with scalability and practical applicability in complex, data‑rich domains like medical imaging.


**Model checking as a pragmatic alternative:**  
Model checking provides automated verification of formally specified properties over finite models via systematic state exploration. Rather than attempting fully general theorem proving, it algorithmically determines whether a model satisfies given temporal or spatial properties. Initially successful in hardware and protocol verification, it now extends to imaging workflows where executable spatial or structural knowledge can be encoded and checked efficiently.

<!-- The key definitions must become a itemized list like latex \begin{description} -->
**Key definitions (plain language):**
- *Automated verification*: using algorithms (not manual proofs) to check whether a system or data instance satisfies a formally stated property.
- *Finite model*: a bounded structure representing system behaviour or data (e.g. a finite-state transition graph; for an image, a finite grid of labelled voxels).
- *Systematic state exploration*: traversing the entire model (often symbolically or with pruning) so that either a counterexample is produced or correctness is confirmed.
- *Temporal properties*: statements about *when* something holds (e.g. “every detected lesion is eventually classified”); typically expressed in temporal logics such as LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) or CTL (Computation Tree Logic).
- *Spatial properties*: statements about *where* patterns, regions, or relations occur (e.g. “necrotic core lies within enhancing tumour region and near ventricle boundary”); expressed via spatial logics over images/models (e.g. closure, distance, reachability, surrounded-by operators).
- *Modal logic*: extends propositional logic with operators that quantify over accessible states (temporal, spatial, epistemic, or structural adjacency). A *modal formula* combines atomic predicates with modalities like ◇ (there exists a reachable state/region) or □ (all reachable states/regions). In imaging, adjacency modalities move between neighbouring voxels or regions.

**Combinatorial explosion:** In parallel or component-rich systems, the naive state space size grows multiplicatively with each independently varying component. Even imaging pipelines can exhibit explosion when tracking multi-stage transformations, annotations, or uncertainty labels jointly. Model checking combats this with symbolic representations (BDDs, SAT/SMT encodings), partial order reduction, abstraction, and compositional reasoning.

<!-- very supernice, but add these historical milestones to bibliography and also links to the referenced tools when they are active -->

**Historical milestones (selective):**
1. 1977 – Pnueli introduces temporal logic for program reasoning.
2. 1981 – Clarke & Emerson, and independently 1982 – Queille & Sifakis, introduce algorithmic model checking.
3. Mid‑1980s – CTL / CTL* foundations; fairness & branching vs linear time clarified.
4. 1990s – Symbolic model checking (BDDs) enables verification of very large systems (McMillan). SPIN advances explicit-state techniques (Holzmann).
5. 2000s – SAT-based bounded model checking (Biere et al.), probabilistic model checking (PRISM), industrial hardware/software adoption.
6. 2010s – Domain-specific adaptation (biological pathways, cyber-physical systems); integration with SMT (IC3 / property-directed reachability).
7. 2010s–2020s – Spatial model checking for images and biological tissues; tools like VoxLogicA apply spatial logics to medical images; hybrid reasoning with statistical outputs.

**Representative tools:** SPIN, NuSMV / nuXmv, PRISM, Uppaal, CBMC, TLA+ toolset, VoxLogicA (spatial / imaging), PRISM-games (strategic reasoning), MCMT (symbolic transition systems), Kind2 (model-based design), Cadence JasperGold / Synopsys VC Formal (industrial).

<!-- Good example, but the text is too dry, arid. Expand a bit, put the person in context, they might not know even what model checking is all about; introduce the idea of counterexample and say that SOME model checkers return counterexamples; say that there are a plethora of different formalisms, most of which belong to the modal logical tradition, to define properties; say that these letters are logical operators, explain that the verification is on the possible path and that even if usually there could be many paths in a program (and this is obviosuly related to combinatorial explosion) in this particualr case there's only one path. Make this a university textbook example. Use latex macros and math for formulas we have the markdown plugins for that -->
**Simple temporal model checking example:**
Consider a tiny transition system (traffic signal): `Green -> Yellow -> Red -> Green` (loop). Property in LTL: `G (Green -> F Yellow)` meaning “whenever Green holds, eventually Yellow occurs.” Traversal detects no counterexample because every path from a Green state immediately reaches Yellow. A failing variant (if a self-loop Green existed without outgoing edge to Yellow) would generate a counterexample trace: `Green, Green, Green, ...`.

<!-- Q: Very cool idea to add a simple spatial model checking example; but add a toy example and use the notation from papers; see in the knowledge base lectures/domain_knowledge/pdfs/978-3-030-84629-9_2.converted.md replace this example. Use latex maths if needed so the symbols match we have the md plugins, but don't assume a preamble with macros -->
**Simple spatial model checking example (imaging):**
Suppose a 2D brain MRI slice is segmented into labeled regions: `Lesion`, `WhiteMatter`, `GrayMatter`, `CSF`. A spatial logic formula could assert that every voxel labeled `Lesion` is (i) within 3 voxels of some `WhiteMatter` region and (ii) not touching `CSF`. Using VoxLogicA-style modalities: `A Lesion -> ( <distance<=3> WhiteMatter & ! (touches CSF) )`. A counterexample pinpoints lesion voxels violating the perilesional constraint, supporting refinement of preprocessing or segmentation heuristics.

By focusing on model checking, the course emphasizes a methodology that is both expressive and practical, enabling specification and automated verification of complex properties in medical images without reliance on full deductive proof frameworks. This reflects a broader trend toward tools that balance rigor, usability, and scalability.

Despite their potential, formal and hybrid methods are still emerging in medical imaging. Challenges include integrating heterogeneous data sources, developing scalable algorithms, and creating user‑friendly tools for clinicians. Interdisciplinary collaboration is essential to bridge research and applied clinical deployment.

Fostering knowledge and skills in these areas supports improved patient outcomes, advances research, and prepares future professionals to navigate an increasingly digital healthcare landscape.

## Multidisciplinary, seminar-style structure of the course

This course is intentionally multidisciplinary and delivered in a seminar style: multiple experts contribute lectures, discussions, and hands‑on sessions. You will encounter complementary viewpoints spanning methodology, imaging practice, data handling, formal reasoning, spatial logics, radiomics, and hybrid AI engineering. Rotating instructors focus on domain strengths, grounding material in current research questions and real‑world constraints.

## Symbolic and Hybrid AI
### Introduction

<!-- define statistical, neural, distributed, very shortly -->
Artificial Intelligence has been shaped by tension between two broad paradigms: symbolic (logic‑ and rule‑based) and subsymbolic (statistical, neural, distributed). Each reflects distinct assumptions about representation and computation. The contemporary push toward hybrid AI—integrating structured knowledge, formal reasoning, and data‑driven learning—responds to the limits of each paradigm in isolation. In medical imaging, where interpretability, robustness, data heterogeneity, and safety are paramount, this integrative turn is especially compelling.

### Roots of the Symbolic Paradigm

The origins of symbolic AI trace back to the **1950s and 1960s**, during the so-called *first AI summer*. Pioneering systems like the *Logic Theorist* and *General Problem Solver* demonstrated that reasoning processes could be captured in computational form. Research at that time focused on **knowledge representation**, heuristics, and automated theorem proving, reflecting a strong optimism about the prospects of human-level intelligence through symbolic reasoning. 

This foundational work framed intelligent behaviour as heuristic search through structured problem spaces governed by production rules. Symbol systems promised transparency, compositionality, and explainability—qualities attractive for domains requiring traceable decision paths. Logic programming and automated theorem proving exemplified declarative specification of domain knowledge.

However, this optimism was tempered by subsequent **AI winters**, as limitations became apparent. Symbolic systems proved brittle: they often failed when faced with incomplete knowledge, ambiguity, or situations outside their carefully designed domains. Knowledge acquisition was another bottleneck, since encoding expertise into formal symbolic rules was time-consuming and error-prone.

The **late 1970s and 1980s** saw the rise of **expert systems**, which encoded specialist knowledge into large rule bases and enjoyed considerable commercial success. These systems demonstrated practical value in fields such as medicine (e.g. MYCIN), engineering, and finance, although their limitations again surfaced when scaling beyond narrow domains.

Prominent figures shaping early AI and symbolic reasoning include: John McCarthy (coined “AI”, Lisp; later work on formal commonsense reasoning), Allen Newell & Herbert A. Simon (human problem solving, Logic Theorist, General Problem Solver; cognitive architectures), Marvin Minsky (frames, society of mind, MIT AI Lab co‑founder), and Edsger W. Dijkstra (structured reasoning, weakest preconditions). Milestones: 1956 Dartmouth workshop (inaugural AI meeting), 1950 Turing Test proposal, 1965 Robinson’s resolution principle, early 1970s logic programming (Kowalski, Colmerauer). Their later careers consolidated subfields: McCarthy advanced formal knowledge representation; Simon pursued cognitive science; Minsky explored architectures of intelligence.

1. Logic Theorist (1956): Early program that proved theorems from *Principia Mathematica* using heuristic search among symbolic transformations—demonstrated feasibility of automated reasoning.
2. General Problem Solver (GPS, late 1950s–1960s): Framework applying means–ends analysis to reduce differences between current and goal states; influential but limited outside well-structured problems.
3. Logic Programming (early 1970s): Paradigm (exemplified by Prolog) where computation arises from resolving logical queries against a database of facts and rules via unification and backtracking.
4. Automated Theorem Proving: Algorithms (e.g. resolution, tableau, term rewriting) that generate formal proofs or refutations; key for verifying mathematical theorems, hardware designs, protocols.

Between the peak of expert systems (1980s) and the deep learning resurgence (post‑2012), AI diversified: probabilistic graphical models (Bayesian networks, Markov random fields) unified reasoning under uncertainty; support vector machines and kernel methods improved generalisation with convex optimisation; reinforcement learning matured (temporal-difference, Q‑learning); statistical NLP shifted from rule sets to corpus-driven models; early neural nets re‑emerged with improved backpropagation insights and regularisation (dropout precursors like weight decay, early stopping). These advances formed the substrate onto which scalable deep architectures (enabled by GPUs and large datasets) were later layered.


### Rise of the Subsymbolic / Connectionist Paradigm

The reaction to symbolic brittleness catalysed interest in distributed representations. Parallel distributed processing demonstrated how networks learn statistical regularities instead of relying on hand‑crafted rules. Meaning emerges from activation patterns and weight configurations. Such systems excel at perceptual tasks (classification, segmentation, pattern completion) where symbolic systems struggled. Challenges remained: limited transparency, compositional generalisation, data efficiency, and handling of multi‑step reasoning or variable binding.

<!-- {Expand key models...} -->
Key subsymbolic model lineage (illustrative):
- Perceptron (Rosenblatt, 1958) – linear classifier on weighted sums; limitations (XOR) catalysed later multilayer work.
- Backpropagation (Rumelhart, Hinton, Williams, 1986) – efficient gradient-based training for multilayer networks.
- Convolutional Neural Networks (LeCun et al., 1990s; breakthrough with LeNet-5) – spatial weight sharing for vision tasks.
- Recurrent Neural Networks (Elman; Hochreiter & Schmidhuber’s LSTM 1997; Cho et al.’s GRU 2014) – sequence modelling via state recurrence.
- Deep CNN era (Krizhevsky, Sutskever, Hinton 2012: AlexNet) – GPU acceleration plus large datasets (ImageNet) triggered performance leaps.
- Residual Networks (He et al., 2015) – skip connections enabling very deep architectures.
- Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) – attention-only sequence modelling scaling to multimodal large language models.

<!-- Expand, it's arid. Terms and concepts are completely undefined-->
**Advent of Deep Learning.** Three converging factors enabled deep learning’s ascent: (i) *data scale* (web corpora, large annotated image repositories); (ii) *compute acceleration* (general-purpose GPUs, later TPUs); (iii) *algorithmic refinements* (ReLUs mitigating vanishing gradients, better initialisation, batch normalisation, regularisation through dropout & data augmentation). ImageNet 2012 demonstrated large accuracy deltas over handcrafted pipelines.

<!-- define things super-shortly -->
In vision, deep CNN stacks replaced feature engineering (SIFT, HOG) with end-to-end learned hierarchies. In speech, deep and later sequence-to-sequence architectures surpassed GMM-HMM pipelines. Reinforcement learning combined deep function approximators with exploration (e.g. Deep Q-Networks) to tackle high-dimensional control.

Transformers generalised the attention mechanism, discarding recurrence and convolutions for parallel token-wise dependency modelling. Scaling laws emerged: performance improves predictably with model/data size under suitable optimisation. Transfer and foundation models now back multi-task adaptation across language, vision, and biomedical domains.

Medical imaging increasingly leverages hybrid patterns: CNN/Transformer backbones for feature extraction plus symbolic/spatial post-hoc verification or constraint injection, improving interpretability and robustness.

### Contemporary Critiques and Extensions

Modern deep learning has dramatically advanced subsymbolic performance while exposing limits: brittleness, shallow abstraction, difficulty with causal inference and flexible transfer. Emerging research emphasizes inductive biases (modularity, attention, sparsity) to promote compositional, higher‑level reasoning.

<!-- {Expand issues} -->
**Brittleness:** Models can latch onto spurious correlations (e.g. scanner artefacts) failing under distribution shift. Robust pipelines incorporate data augmentation, domain adaptation, and symbolic constraints to reject inconsistent outputs.

**Shallow abstraction:** Pure pattern matching may not encode hierarchical causal structure. Hybrid layering adds symbolic schemas (e.g. anatomical ontologies) above raw feature maps.

**Causal inference limitations:** Correlation-based representations struggle to predict intervention effects. 

**Transfer inefficiency:** Significant retraining is often required when modality, resolution, or cohort shifts. Parameter-efficient tuning and modular symbolic components reduce adaptation cost.

**Explainability gaps:** Attention maps or saliency heatmaps are post-hoc; embedding formal properties (e.g. region adjacency invariants) yields intrinsic, checkable explanations.

*Dual‑layer perspectives emphasise that robust intelligence integrates implicit (procedural, distributed) and explicit (declarative, rule‑based) knowledge. This resonates with imaging workflows where low‑level feature extraction must interface with higher‑level anatomical or clinical concepts.*

Concerns about alignment and control motivate explicit modelling of preferences, uncertainty, and consequences. Embedding structured models alongside learned components supports safer, auditable decision pipelines.

### Structural Limitations Driving Hybridization

| Limitation | Symbolic Systems | Subsymbolic Systems | Hybrid Opportunity |
|------------|-----------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Perception | Fragile; require engineered feature extraction | Strong at pattern recognition | Learned perception feeding structured reasoning |
| Compositional reasoning | Native strength (explicit variables, logic) | Often implicit, can fail at systematic generalisation | Neural modules interfaced with symbolic planners / constraint solvers |
| Transparency / Explainability | High (traceable inference chains) | Low / post‑hoc explanations needed | Combine introspectable logic layers with learned embeddings |
| Safety / Guarantees | Amenable to verification | Hard to certify globally | Verified symbolic shells constraining neural proposals |


Together, the comparison table and action items outline a design pattern: apply neural components where raw variability and high-dimensional pattern learning are indispensable; elevate symbolic layers where structure, guarantees, or interpretability dominate requirements; and build deliberate interfaces (aligned representations, constraints, verification hooks) so that signal flows and logical abstractions co-evolve instead of competing. 

*The practical decision is rarely “symbolic versus neural” but how to sequence, couple, and govern them.*


### Synthesis of Author Perspectives
The hybrid AI narrative is a convergence of partially overlapping research agendas. Each of the following perspectives stresses a different bottleneck (scalability, abstraction, safety, causality, modularity) and supplies design levers rather than slogans. Read them as complementary facets of a single engineering objective: dependable generalisation under constraint.

<!-- Make this less a named list and more a flowing text with paragraphs; merge with subsequent itemization  -->
Illustrative researchers per perspective: symbolic search (Newell, Simon), distributed learning (Hinton, LeCun, Bengio), structural critique (Marcus), inductive bias (Battaglia – relational reasoning; Tenenbaum – cognitive programs), dual-process / System 2 (Bengio; Kahneman inspiration), alignment & safety (Russell, Amodei, Hadfield-Menell).

- Symbolic search tradition: Intelligence as symbol manipulation plus heuristic exploration of structured problem spaces.
- Distributed learning tradition: Intelligence emergent from adaptive networks; learning reduces manual knowledge engineering.
- Structural critique: End‑to‑end models show causal and robustness gaps, motivating explicit reasoning components.
- Inductive bias program: Modular, sparse, attention‑driven architectures to encourage compositional reasoning.
- Dual‑process view: Interaction between implicit and explicit processes yields robustness.
- Alignment perspective: Safety and corrigibility require explicit modelling of preferences, goals, and uncertainty.

Taken together these viewpoints converge on a hybrid thesis: future AI must integrate learned perceptual grounding with structured, inspectable reasoning to achieve robustness, generalisation, safety, and alignment in critical domains. The practical payoff is concrete: constraints, modular decomposition, explicit goals, and verifiable properties become first-class architectural components.


# Historical Connections Between Logic and Artificial Intelligence

Logic and AI are tightly intertwined. Logic first contributed formal languages and inference rules; later it offered specification and verification techniques; now it reappears inside hybrid pipelines as a means of articulating constraints, auditing behaviour, and structuring knowledge alongside learned representations. The following sections give a scaffolded tour: foundational formalisms, deployment-era expert systems, their evolution into data‑driven medical AI, and the contemporary reintegration under hybrid paradigms.

## Early Roots: Logic and Reasoning
Early logical systems supplied the abstraction machinery (symbols, quantifiers, proof procedures) that made computational reasoning thinkable. They also delineated limits—through incompleteness and undecidability—that still inform feasibility assessments for automated inference. The timeline below highlights inflection points and how each widened the design space for machine reasoning.

| Period | Milestone | Contribution |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| Antiquity → 19th c. | Aristotelian syllogistics → Frege’s predicate logic | Formal systems for reasoning; basis for symbolic representation. |
| 19th c. | George Boole (Boolean algebra, 1854) | Algebraic formulation of logic, foundation for digital circuits and symbolic computation. |
| 1930s–40s | Gödel, Turing, Church | Limits of logic (incompleteness, decidability) and computational models (Turing machines). |
| 1950s | **Logic Theorist** (Newell & Simon, 1956) | First AI program: proved theorems from *Principia Mathematica*; milestone in automated reasoning. |
| 1960s | Automated theorem proving (Robinson’s resolution, 1965) | Efficient deduction technique; foundation for formal reasoning systems. |
| 1970s | Logic programming (Prolog, Kowalski, 1972) | Unified knowledge representation and inference; widely used in AI and symbolic reasoning. |
| 1980s | Description logics (precursors of OWL) | Structured reasoning for ontologies, medical informatics, semantic web. |
| 1990s–2000s | Knowledge representation, semantic web | Ontology-based reasoning integrated into web standards. |
| 2010s–today | Hybrid AI (neural-symbolic) | Combines statistical learning with logic-based reasoning. |

👉 Logic provided **formalisms, inference methods, and knowledge representation** that shaped entire generations of AI systems.
