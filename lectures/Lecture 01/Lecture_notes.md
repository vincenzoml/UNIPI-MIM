## Formal methods for medical imaging

This course focuses on a selection of topics positioned between classical programming and AI. For the symbolic part, we study *model checking*. This approach departs from the traditional deductive view of symbolic AI (theorem proving, logic programming) and instead emphasizes the pragmatic use of executable domain knowledge. Properties of a system (or, here, medical images and their derived feature structures) are specified formally and then automatically verified against concrete models using efficient algorithms. This paradigm has proven effective in computer vision applications only relatively recently.

<!-- SLIDE -->
<!-- NOTES -->


**Deductive tradition in symbolic AI:**  
The deductive tradition in symbolic AI dates back to the earliest logic‑inspired systems. Early programs such as the Logic Theorist and later the emergence of logic programming focused on deriving conclusions from axioms using inference rules—automated reasoning and theorem proving. These approaches are powerful for expressing general knowledge and proving properties rigorously, but they struggle with scalability and practical applicability in complex, data‑rich domains like medical imaging.

<!-- SLIDE -->
<!-- NOTES -->

**Model checking as a pragmatic alternative:**  
Model checking provides automated verification of formally specified properties over finite models via systematic state exploration. Rather than attempting fully general theorem proving, it algorithmically determines whether a model satisfies given temporal/spatial properties. Initially successful in hardware and protocol verification, it now extends to imaging workflows where executable spatial or structural knowledge can be encoded and checked efficiently. (Editorial placeholders removed; original citation notes resolved.)

<!-- SLIDE -->
<!-- NOTES -->


By focusing on model checking, the course emphasizes a methodology that is both expressive and practical, enabling specification and automated verification of complex properties in medical images without reliance on full deductive proof frameworks. This reflects a broader trend toward tools that balance rigor, usability, and scalability.

<!-- SLIDE -->
<!-- NOTES -->


Despite their potential, symbolic and hybrid methods are still emerging in medical imaging. Challenges include integrating heterogeneous data sources, developing scalable algorithms, and creating user‑friendly tools for clinicians. Interdisciplinary collaboration is essential to bridge research and applied clinical deployment.

<!-- SLIDE -->
<!-- NOTES -->


Fostering knowledge and skills in these areas supports improved patient outcomes, advances research, and prepares future professionals to navigate an increasingly digital healthcare landscape.

## Multidisciplinary, seminar-style structure of the course

This course is intentionally multidisciplinary and delivered in a seminar style: multiple experts contribute lectures, discussions, and hands‑on sessions. You will encounter complementary viewpoints spanning methodology, imaging practice, data handling, formal reasoning, spatial logics, radiomics, and hybrid AI engineering. Rotating instructors focus on domain strengths, grounding material in current research questions and real‑world constraints.

### Complementary thematic threads (as reflected in the schedule)

- Foundations of paradigms: symbolic, formal, subsymbolic, and hybrid approaches; positioning model checking among verification techniques

- Ethics and human‑centric AI: responsible use, transparency, professional considerations

- Medical imaging physics & modalities: CT / MRI acquisition principles and reconstruction pipelines

- Image reconstruction & enhancement: algorithms, low‑dose strategies, artifact reduction, links to deep learning

- Data engineering & preparation: pipeline design, dataset creation, curation, governance

- Pre-processing & segmentation fundamentals: from theoretical principles to practical brain imaging segmentation

## Symbolic and Hybrid AI
### Introduction

Artificial Intelligence has been shaped by tension between two broad paradigms: symbolic (logic‑ and rule‑based) and subsymbolic (statistical, neural, distributed). Each reflects distinct assumptions about representation and computation. The contemporary push toward hybrid AI—integrating structured knowledge, formal reasoning, and data‑driven learning—responds to the limits of each paradigm in isolation. In medical imaging, where interpretability, robustness, data heterogeneity, and safety are paramount, this integrative turn is especially compelling.

### 1. Roots of the Symbolic Paradigm

The symbolic tradition formalised cognition as manipulation of abstract structures. Foundational work (Logic Theorist, General Problem Solver) framed intelligent behaviour as heuristic search through structured problem spaces governed by production rules. Symbol systems promised transparency, compositionality, and explainability—qualities attractive for domains requiring traceable decision paths. Logic programming and automated theorem proving exemplified declarative specification of domain knowledge. Scaling exposed limitations: brittleness, combinatorial explosion, difficulty bridging noisy perceptual data.

### 2. Rise of the Subsymbolic / Connectionist Paradigm

The reaction to symbolic brittleness catalysed interest in distributed representations. Parallel distributed processing demonstrated how networks learn statistical regularities instead of relying on hand‑crafted rules. Meaning emerges from activation patterns and weight configurations. Such systems excel at perceptual tasks (classification, segmentation, pattern completion) where symbolic systems struggled. Challenges remained: limited transparency, compositional generalisation, data efficiency, and handling of multi‑step reasoning or variable binding.

### 3. Contemporary Critiques and Extensions

Modern deep learning has dramatically advanced subsymbolic performance while exposing limits: brittleness, shallow abstraction, difficulty with causal inference and flexible transfer. Emerging research emphasizes inductive biases (modularity, attention, sparsity) to promote compositional, higher‑level reasoning.

Dual‑layer perspectives emphasise that robust intelligence integrates implicit (procedural, distributed) and explicit (declarative, rule‑based) knowledge. This resonates with imaging workflows where low‑level feature extraction must interface with higher‑level anatomical or clinical concepts.

Concerns about alignment and control motivate explicit modelling of preferences, uncertainty, and consequences. Embedding structured models alongside learned components supports safer, auditable decision pipelines.

### 4. Structural Limitations Driving Hybridization

| Limitation | Symbolic Systems | Subsymbolic Systems | Hybrid Opportunity |
|------------|-----------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Perception | Fragile; require engineered feature extraction | Strong at pattern recognition | Learned perception feeding structured reasoning |
| Compositional reasoning | Native strength (explicit variables, logic) | Often implicit, can fail at systematic generalisation | Neural modules interfaced with symbolic planners / constraint solvers |
| Data efficiency | Potentially high if knowledge engineered | Often data‑hungry | Inject prior knowledge to reduce sample complexity |
| Transparency / Explainability | High (traceable inference chains) | Low / post‑hoc explanations needed | Combine introspectable logic layers with learned embeddings |
| Robustness / Out‑of‑Distribution | Rule‑bound but brittle to unmodelled variance | Generalise locally; fragile to distribution shift | Formal constraints + uncertainty models guiding adaptation |
| Safety / Guarantees | Amenable to verification, model checking | Hard to certify globally | Verified symbolic shells constraining neural proposals |

1. Representation Alignment: Bridge continuous embeddings and discrete symbols (e.g. via concept bottlenecks, prototype layers, or learned predicate grounding) so that formal operators (quantifiers, spatial relations) act meaningfully over learned features.
2. Modularity and Compositionality: Reflect Bengio’s call for modular inductive biases; encourage re‑usable components whose behaviour can be locally reasoned about or verified.
3. Constraint Integration: Encode domain knowledge (anatomical topology, physical plausibility) as declarative constraints guiding training (loss shaping), inference (search pruning), or post‑hoc validation (reject / flag inconsistent outputs).
4. Uncertainty and Alignment: Following Russell, incorporate probabilistic and preference models enabling deference, calibration, and safe fallback behaviours.
5. Bidirectional Learning: Inspired by Sun, allow implicit (neural) layers to propose hypotheses refined by explicit reasoning, with symbolic feedback shaping representation learning (e.g. through constraint‑based gradients).
6. Lifecycle Verification: Employ model checking or temporal/spatial logic to audit key properties (e.g. no lesion mask encroaches forbidden anatomical zones) across datasets and updates.

### 6. Application Lens: Medical Imaging

Medical imaging exemplifies hybrid needs: raw voxel data require high‑capacity perceptual extraction, yet clinical utility depends on structured interpretation and safety constraints. Symbolic spatial logics (e.g. VoxLogicA) enable declarative specification of image properties. Neural networks propose segmentations; logical layers can verify, constrain, and provide provenance.

### 7. Current Research Directions

Research explores differentiable reasoning layers, graph‑neuro integration, constraint‑augmented training, and abstraction techniques enabling partial verification of deep models. Evaluation increasingly blends statistical metrics with logical property satisfaction to align with robustness and safety goals.

### 8. Synthesis of Author Perspectives

- Symbolic search tradition: Intelligence as symbol manipulation plus heuristic exploration of structured problem spaces.
- Distributed learning tradition: Intelligence emergent from adaptive networks; learning reduces manual knowledge engineering.
- Structural critique: End‑to‑end models show causal and robustness gaps, motivating explicit reasoning components.
- Inductive bias program: Modular, sparse, attention‑driven architectures to encourage compositional reasoning.
- Dual‑process view: Interaction between implicit and explicit processes yields robustness.
- Alignment perspective: Safety and corrigibility require explicit modelling of preferences, goals, and uncertainty.

Collectively these viewpoints converge on a hybrid thesis: future AI must integrate learned perceptual grounding with structured, inspectable reasoning to achieve robustness, generalisation, safety, and alignment in critical domains.

### 9. Why Hybrid AI Now?

Three converging forces make hybrid AI urgent today: (i) diminishing returns from scaling alone; (ii) governance needs for auditability, fairness, and assurance; (iii) integration pressures from multi‑modal biomedical data. Hybrid AI encodes invariants, fuses modalities, and embeds neural components within logic‑ and constraint‑guided scaffolds. Model checking illustrates a mature symbolic instrument composable with neural methods for explainable, dependable imaging analytics.

In summary, hybrid AI is not a compromise; it is an evidence‑based synthesis responding to long‑observed limitations. By combining structured abstraction with flexible perception, we move toward systems capable of trustworthy, generalisable, and ethically aligned operation in complex domains such as medical imaging.


# Historical Connections Between Logic and Artificial Intelligence

## Early Roots: Logic and Reasoning

Artificial Intelligence has been deeply influenced by formal logic since its inception.

| Period | Milestone | Contribution |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| Antiquity → 19th c. | Aristotelian syllogistics → Frege’s predicate logic | Formal systems for reasoning; basis for symbolic representation. |

## Expert Systems: From Prototypes to Real-World Deployment

Expert systems (1970s–1980s) were the first major wave of AI to leave the lab and enter industrial/medical practice.

#### Canonical Academic Prototype

| System | Domain | Technology | Impact | Limitation |
|--------|--------|------------|--------|------------|
| **MYCIN** (1970s, Stanford) | Medical diagnosis (bacterial infections, blood diseases) | Rule-based inference (~450 production rules) | Demonstrated expert-level reasoning could be encoded in rules | Not deployed clinically (legal/ethical concerns) |

---

#### Canonical Industrial Success

| System | Domain | Technology | Impact | Use |

## Radiomics in the Image Processing Pipeline

Radiomics sits **after image acquisition and pre-processing, but before predictive modeling**:

1. **Image acquisition** (CT, MRI, PET, X-ray).  
2. **Pre-processing** (normalization, noise reduction, segmentation).  
3. **Feature extraction** (radiomics: quantitative features like shape, texture, intensity).  
4. **Data integration** (with clinical/genomic info).  
5. **Modeling & prediction** (ML/AI models for diagnosis, prognosis, therapy planning).  

---

## Hybrid AI Pipelines (Today)

- **Neural-symbolic AI**: combines statistical learning with symbolic reasoning.  
- **Applications in medicine**: combining radiomic features with logical/ontological reasoning (e.g., linking imaging biomarkers with disease ontologies).  
- **Industry trend**: From purely rule-based expert systems (XCON, PROSPECTOR) → to hybrid AI pipelines (Watson, Zebra, radiomics platforms).  

---

### Key Takeaways

- Logic has been a **constant backbone** of AI, from Aristotle → Boole → Turing → Logic Theorist → Prolog → description logics → neural-symbolic AI.  
- Expert systems (1970s–80s) marked the **first wave of AI in practice**, with notable successes like **XCON** and **PROSPECTOR**.  
- Medicine pioneered both **prototypes (MYCIN)** and **deployments (PUFF, Watson, Zebra)**.  
- Radiomics and hybrid AI pipelines represent the **modern integration of symbolic and statistical approaches**.



## Symbolic Artificial Intelligence

Symbolic Artificial Intelligence, also known as **classical AI** or **logic-based AI**, refers to approaches that represent knowledge and reasoning explicitly through symbols and rules. In this paradigm, the world is modeled in terms of entities, their properties, and relationships, making it possible to perform logical inference, planning, and problem solving. This contrasts with subsymbolic methods, such as neural networks, which operate on numerical data without explicit symbolic structures.

### Historical Development

The origins of symbolic AI trace back to the **1950s and 1960s**, during the so-called *first AI summer*. Pioneering systems like the *Logic Theorist* and *General Problem Solver* demonstrated that reasoning processes could be captured in computational form. Research at that time focused on **knowledge representation**, heuristics, and automated theorem proving, reflecting a strong optimism about the prospects of human-level intelligence through symbolic reasoning.

However, this optimism was tempered by subsequent **AI winters**, as limitations became apparent. Symbolic systems proved brittle: they often failed when faced with incomplete knowledge, ambiguity, or situations outside their carefully designed domains. Knowledge acquisition was another bottleneck, since encoding expertise into formal symbolic rules was time-consuming and error-prone.

The **late 1970s and 1980s** saw the rise of **expert systems**, which encoded specialist knowledge into large rule bases and enjoyed considerable commercial success. These systems demonstrated practical value in fields such as medicine (e.g. MYCIN), engineering, and finance, although their limitations again surfaced when scaling beyond narrow domains.

### Strengths and Weaknesses

Symbolic AI excels in tasks requiring **explicit reasoning**, **planning**, and **interpretability**. Because rules and symbols are human-readable, the systems’ decisions can be explained and justified. They perform well in domains that are well specified and logically structured.

On the other hand, symbolic approaches struggle with **scalability**, **common-sense reasoning**, and **robustness** in open-world contexts. They are not well suited to perception-heavy tasks such as vision or speech recognition, where subsymbolic methods like deep learning have proven more successful.

### Contemporary Directions

In recent years, there has been a growing movement towards **neuro-symbolic AI**, which aims to combine the strengths of symbolic and subsymbolic paradigms. The idea is to use neural networks for perception and pattern recognition, while employing symbolic methods for reasoning, structure, and explainability. This integration is viewed by many as a promising path toward more general and robust forms of artificial intelligence.
