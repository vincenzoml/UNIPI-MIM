# Introduction

- Symbolic, formal, subsymbolic, hybrid methods

- Physics (principles of medical imaging)
  - Where do images come from?
  - Different types of images (MRI, CAT, Ultrasound, etc.)
  - What are the imaging modalities
  - reconstruction
  
- The lifecycle of data analysis:  
  - the notion of dataset
  - preprocessing, processing, postprocessing  
  - dataset preparation (harmonization,...)

- Principles of image processing
  - Problems in image analysis: detection, segmentation, contouring, volumetry, statistics, ...
  - Convolution, edge detection
  - Digital morphology
