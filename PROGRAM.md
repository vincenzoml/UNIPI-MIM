# Detailed program


# Introduction

- Symbolic, formal, subsymbolic, hybrid methods

- Physics (principles of medical imaging)
  - Where do images come from?
  - Different types of images (MRI, CAT, Ultrasound, etc.)
  - What are the imaging modalities
  - reconstruction
  
- The lifecycle of data analysis:  
  - the notion of dataset
  - preprocessing, processing, postprocessing  
  - dataset preparation (harmonization,...)

- Principles of image processing

  - Problems in image analysis: detection, segmentation, contouring, volumetry, statistics, ...
  - Convolution, edge detection
  - Digital morphology
  - Imaging features, descriptors, radiomics, tools

- Programming for Medical Imaging 

  - File formats
  - ITK/SimpleITK and OpenCV libraries
  - Medical Imaging exercises in Python

## Declarative image analysis

- Introduction to formal methods and model checking
- Spatial models for images (Closure Spaces)
- Spatial logic for images
- The spatial model checker VoxLogicA
- Declarative image analysis exercises
- Case studies (Segmentation of Brain lesions, Brain tissue identification, segmentation of skin lesions)


## Machine learning and radiomics 

- General considerations and ethical / professional aspects (also in data management, model cards, ...)
- NNUNet: A fully automatic neural network dedicated to image segmentation
- Case study: Prostate tumours, breast tumours

## Hybrid methods

- Brain tumour segmentation
- Black-box network capabilities
