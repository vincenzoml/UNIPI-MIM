# Course Schedule — Formal and Hybrid Methods for Medical Imaging (MIM)

- Duration: 12 weeks
- Classes: Mondays and Wednesdays at 14:00 (2h each)
- Organization: Week 6 (mid-term) and Week 12 (final) are reserved for review + exam, leaving 10 teaching weeks.
- Practical sessions: dedicated hands-on classes (2h) are scheduled for programming and image analysis tools.

Teachers and subjects
- Vincenzo Ciancia — Programming for Medical Imaging; Declarative Image Analysis; Hybrid methods; Intro to symbolic/formal/subsymbolic/hybrid methods
- Mieke Massink — Case studies
- Sara Colantonio — The lifecycle of data analysis
- Manuela Imbriani — Physics (principles of medical imaging)
- Danila Germanese — Principles of image processing; Machine learning and radiomics

Constraint check
- Physics lasts one week (Week 2): OK
- Practical sessions occupy one full class: OK (Weeks 4W, 5W, 7W, 10W)
- Vincenzo + Mieke + Manuela teach ≥ 6 teaching weeks: OK (Vincenzo W1,5,7,9,10,11 = 6; Mieke W9,10 = 2; Manuela W2 = 1)
